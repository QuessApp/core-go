## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
$  git clone https://github.com/QuessApp/core-go
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
$  cd core-go
```

Run commands to start the project:

```bash
$ make start
```

or

```bash
$ ./scripts/start.sh
```

When you run the above command, it will perform some actions, such as:

- Will check if `.env` file exists
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` if doesn't exist yet
- Run containers from `docker-compose.yml` file (you need to run Docker on pc)
- Finally, start the project based in `ENV` property from `.env` file

If you want to destroy everything, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ make destroy
```

or

```bash
$ ./scripts/destroy.sh
```

When you run the above command, it will perform some actions, such as:

- Delete all containers created previously
- Delete `tmp` folder
